   Abstract = {{Ice crystals deform easily by dislocation glide on basal planes, which
      provides only two independent easy slip systems. The necessary slip on
         other systems limits the strain rate of polycrystalline ice, The
	    preferred c axis orientation of ice from polar ice sheets develops as a
	       result of intracrystalline slip, An anisotropic viscoplastic
	          self-consistent (VPSC) approach is used for predicting texture
		     development and mechanical behavior of polycrystalline ice. Results are
		        compared with lower and upper bound estimations. It is assumed that ice
			   crystals deform by basal, prismatic, and pyramidal slip. The resistance
			      of each slip system is determined from experimental data on monocrystals
			         and isotropic polycrystals. The VPSC model can predict the behavior of
				    isotropic polycrystalline ice on both the macroscopic and microscopic
				       scale. This is not the case for the lower and upper bounds. Fabrics
				          simulated in uniaxial extension and compression are qualitatively
					     similar for all models. However, large differences in the rate of fabric
					        development are found. This is explained by the different interaction
						   stiffness between grain and matrix. Fabric concentration obtained with
						      the VPSC model for uniaxial deformation is in close agreement with those
						         observed in polar ices, In simple shear, the single maximum fabric found
							    in situ cannot be reproduced without an extensive (and probably
							       unrealistic) activity of nonbasal systems, The preferential growth of
							          grains well oriented for basal glide associated with rotation
								     recrystallization could be at the origin of the discrepancy between
								        model results and natural simple shear fabrics. Distorted grain shape is
									   found to slightly slow down fabric development.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{150}},
Pages = {{338-345}},
Abstract = {{Ice at depth in ice sheets can be softer in bed-parallel shear than
   Glen's flow law predicts. For example, at Dye 3, Greenland, enhancement
   factors of 3-4 are needed in order to explain the rate of borehole
   tilting. Previous authors have identified crystal fabric as the dominant
   contributor, but the role of impurities and crystal size is still
   incompletely resolved. Here we use two formulations of anisotropic flow
   laws for ice (Azuma's and Sachs' models) to account for the effects of
   anisotropy, and show that: the measured anisotropy of the ice at Dye 3
   cannot explain all the detailed variations in the measured strain rates.
   The jump in enhancement across the Holocene-Wisconsin boundary is larger
   than expected from the measured fabrics alone. Dust and soluble-ion
   concentration divided by crystal size correlates well with the residual
   enhancement, indicating that most of the ``excess deformation{''} may be
   due to impurities or crystal size. While the major features of the
   deformation at Dye 3 are explained by anisotropy and temperature,
   results also suggest that further research into the role of impurities
   and crystal size is warranted.}},
