% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Strigraphic disturbances}

\begin{frame}{}{Subtitles are optional.}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    
  \item
    Use very short sentences or short phrases.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ice is very anisotropic}

  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ice deforms mostly be shear parallel to the basal plane.
  \item Other slip systems ~100x harder
    \item If ice grains are random, no problem.
    \pause \item But they usually aren't.
    \pause \item Grains rotate away from the axes of extension $\rightarrow$ bulk anisotropic plasticity
  \item This can cause bulk flow to be highly anisotropic.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Current work}

\subsection{Ice fabric evolution}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item \citet{azuma94} 
      \item \citet{thorsteinsson2002nni} developed a fabric model including nearest-neighbor interaction.
      \item We have developed a new model for evolution of a finite number of grains.
      \item The model includes generalized nearest neighbor interaction, mass conservation, and recrystallization.
   \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Neighbors and mass balance}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Each grain has a number of nearest neighbors in an undirected graph.
      \item Grains transfer mass between each other - one grain's loss is another's gain.
      \item Mass flux is determined by grain boundary velocity and shared boundary area.

   \end{itemize}
\begin{tikzpicture}[main_node/.style={circle,fill=blue!20,draw,minimum size=2em,inner sep=3pt]},scale=2]

    \node[circle,fill=red!20,draw,minimum size=4em] (1) at (0,0) {big};
    \node[main_node] (2) at (1, -0.3)  {};
    \node[main_node] (3) at (1.3, 0.2) {};
    \node[main_node] (4) at (2,0) {};
    \draw (1) -- (2) -- (3) -- (2) -- (4);
\end{tikzpicture} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Normal grain growth}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Average grain size increases with depth, until polygonization and recrystallization become important.
      \item This is driven by curvature energy: Highly curved interfaces have a lot of free energy $\rightarrow$ small grains shrink
      \item Grain-boundary velocity computed by estimating the curvature at the interface.
   \end{itemize}

\subsection{Coupled anisotropic ice flow/fabric evolution}
\begin{frame}{Flow and fabric}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Ice fabric development is driven by flow, so this is a coupled system.
   \item \citet{montgomery-smith2011} found that Stokes flow of a fluid with slender fiber inclusions coupled to Jeffery's equation is unstable in response to perturbations of the orientation distribution function.
   \item \citet{gillet2006} found a large-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz-looking instability in their coupled model Jefferys/linear anisotropic ice flow model.
   \item Can an initial random perturbation become a strong perturbation?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Shear bands and boudinage}
   \begin{columns}[T]
   \column{0.6\textwidth}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Under horizontal simple shear, c-axes go to vertical - soft ice
      \item A layer that is initially softer will shear faster, and get softer faster 
      $\rightarrow$ a shear band.
      \item Boudinage is different. C-axes go to vertical with uniaxial compression, but that's the hard orientation.
   \end{itemize}
   \column{0.5\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=3in]{boudinage}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Layer folding}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Shear overturns incipient wrinkles, horizontal extension flattens them.
      \item \citet{alley97} showed that anisotropy exacerbates this by making ice soft in shear and hard in uniaxial compression.
      \item Incipient wrinkles could be caused by stripes, or transient flow.
   \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{GOLF flow}
   \begin{columns}{T}
   \column{0.5\textwidth}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item The General Orthotropic Linear Flow (GOLF) law is a constitutive relation depending on six viscosity parameters.
      \item It assumes the ODF is orthotropic.
   \end{itemize}
   \column{0.5\textwidth}
   \begin{equation}
   S_{ij} = \eta_0 \left[ \eta_r M_{rkl} D_{kl} \left( M_{rij}^D \right)  + \eta_{r+3} \left( D_{ik} M_{rkj} + D_{kj} M_{rik} \right)^D \right],
   \end{equation}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fabric evolution}
   %closure approx
   \begin{itemize}
      \item \citet{gillet2006} use a tensor-closure approximation for Jefferys equation. This very common in fiber injection molding modeling. 
      \item $A^2= < c \otimes c>$. 
   \end{itemize} \\
   \begin{equation}
      \frac{\partial A_{ij}}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k} A_{ij} u_k + W_{ik} A_{kj} - A_{ik} W_{kj} - (D_{ik}W_{kj} + D_{kj}W_{ik}) + 2 \mathbb{A}_{ijkl} C_{kl}
   \end{equation}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Perturbations}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Other analytical work}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Anisotropic ice flow is still a relatively untapped area.
      \item 
   \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Future work}

\begin{frame}{Is GOLF sufficient to explain anisotropic flow?}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Fluids made up of linearly viscous transversely isotropic components do not depend on higher than $4^{th}$ order orientation tensors.
      \item GOLF assumes orthotropy, which does not hold in general for fourth order tensors.
      \item Also, ice is not linear, and nearest-neighber interactions seem to be important for ice.
      \item Does this mean that we need a more general flow model to address these shortcomings? \\
         \pause I don't think so, but maybe.
   \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Is GOLF sufficient to explain anisotropic flow?}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Nearest neighbor interaction makes a big difference with fabric evolution. Some grains get $>10 \times$ softness.
      \item This only makes for differences of $~1\%$ in bulk viscosity. But is is possible to construct fabrics where it the difference is bigger.
      \item Strain softening might be a similar situation.
      \item I propose investigating this question numerically for different fabrics. This will determine whether it is necessary to expand on GOLF.
      \item Prediction of fabric orientation would be improved by a higher-order evolution equation, either up to the sixth-order orientation tensor or using spherical harmonics.
   \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Numerical flow modeling}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item To expand things beyond first order, I propose investigating mesoscale anisotropic flow with a 3d model in a box geometry.
      \item We can user Elmer/Ice FEM with the GOLF flow law.
      \item If we roll our own, we would use a simple finite volume scheme. Numerically, it is similar to to standard Stokes flow.
   \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item This provides a plan for three or four papers.
      \item We will submit the paper on the fabric model shortly.
      \item The
