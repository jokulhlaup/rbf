% - Give the names in the same order as the appear in the paper.
% - Use the \inst{?} command only if the authors have different
%   affiliation.

\institute[University of Washington] % (optional, but mostly needed)
{
  \inst{1}%
  Department of Earth and Space Sciences\\

\date[CFP 2003] % (optional, should be abbreviation of conference name)
%{Conference on Fabulous Presentations, 2003}

% If you have a file called "university-logo-filename.xxx", where xxx

% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Strigraphic disturbances}

\begin{frame}{}{Subtitles are optional.}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    
  \item
    Use very short sentences or short phrases.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ice is very anisotropic}

  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ice deforms mostly be shear parallel to the basal plane.
  \item Other slip systems ~100x harder
    \item If ice grains are random, no problem.
    \pause \item But they usually aren't.
    \pause \item Grains rotate away from the axes of extension $\rightarrow$ bulk anisotropic plasticity
  \item This can cause bulk flow to be highly anisotropic.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Previous Work}

\begin{frame}{Observed statigraphic disturbances}
   \item There are smaller-scale disturbances seen well off beds.
      \pause Too short wavelength to be due to bed.
\end{frame}

\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}

  % Keep the summary *very short*.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \alert{first main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    The \alert{second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    Perhaps a \alert{third message}, but not more than that.
  \end{itemize}
  
  % The following outlook is optional.

  \begin{itemize}

    Outlook
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Something you haven't solved.
    \item
